# Installation


## Stable release


To install HtmlTestRunner, run this command in your terminal:

```batch

    $ pip install html-testRunner
```

This is the preferred method to install HtmlTestRunner, as it will always install the most recent stable release. If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) can guide
you through the process.
